  - Dash bonds (stereochemistry - pointing down)
- **Functional Groups**: Quick-add common groups
  - Hydroxyl (-OH)
  - Amino (-NH₂)
  - Carboxyl (-COOH)
  - Aldehyde (-CHO)
  - Methyl (-CH₃)
  - Nitro (-NO₂)

### ✏️ Editing Capabilities
- **Select & Move**: Drag atoms to reposition them (bonds automatically adjust)
- **Delete**: Remove atoms or bonds with a click
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover highlights and status indicators

### 📤 Export Options
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy diagrams as images for pasting into Word, PowerPoint, etc.

## How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Start drawing your molecular structure!

### Creating Molecules

#### Adding Atoms
1. Click the **Atom** tool (or it's selected by default)
2. Choose an element from the Atoms section (C, H, O, N, etc.)
3. Click on the canvas where you want to place the atom

#### Adding Bonds
1. Click the **Bond** tool
2. Select a bond type (single, double, triple, wedge, or dash)
3. Click on the first atom
4. Click on the second atom to create the bond

#### Adding Functional Groups
1. Click on a functional group button (-OH, -NH₂, -COOH, etc.)
2. Click on any atom to attach the functional group

#### Moving Atoms
1. Click the **Select** tool
2. Drag any atom to a new position
3. Connected bonds will automatically follow

#### Deleting
1. Click the **Delete** tool
2. Click on atoms or bonds to remove them

### Exporting Your Work

#### Copy to Clipboard (Recommended)
1. Click the **Copy Image** button
2. Paste (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V) directly into Word, PowerPoint, or any other application
3. The image will be inserted as a high-quality PNG

#### Download as PNG
1. Click the **Download PNG** button
2. Save the file to your computer
3. Insert the image into your documents as needed
